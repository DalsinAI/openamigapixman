# OpenAmigaPixman

`pixman.library` for AmigaOS 3.x gives Pixman's interface to Amiga programs. From 2.0 it is a thin layer over OpenGPU, and OpenGPU draws the pixels:

- on AmigaChrome, on the host, behind OpenGPU's ACRTG.gpu driver;
- on any Amiga, in opengpu.library's own 68k back end.

No upstream Pixman is inside the library. Upstream Pixman 0.46.4 is the reference that the tests compare against, pixel for pixel. `DESIGN.md` has the call map, the gaps and the stages.

## Baseline

- **Interface:** Pixman 0.46.4's types and calls, through the LVOs in `library/pixman_lib.sfd` (unchanged from 1.0) and the request blocks in `include/libraries/pixman.h`.
- **Library version:** 2.0.
- **Needs:** opengpu.library with OpenGPU stream v1.4 (COMPOSITE_PD; DalsinAI/openamigartg). Without it, `OpenLibrary("pixman.library")` fails.
- **CPU:** 68040, soft float. The library has no floating point at all, so it also runs on an LC040 or EC040. The build fails if an FPU instruction gets in.
- **Formats:** a8r8g8b8, x8r8g8b8, b8g8r8a8, r5g6b5, x1r5g5b5 and a8.
- **Operators:** CLEAR to ADD.
- **Sources:** solid colours and images, with repeat NONE or NORMAL and integer translations.
- **Masks:** A8, ARGB32 or a solid alpha.
- **Not yet:** the rest are refused and counted (`DESIGN.md`, "Gaps").

## Build

```sh
./build-library.sh      # out/lib/pixman.library (about 16 KB)
./build-test.sh         # out/tests/PixmanTest, the smoke test (tests/pixmansmoke.c)
./build-bench.sh        # out/tests/PixBench
tests/run.sh [CASES]    # pixman.library against upstream Pixman, on qemu-m68k
```

- **The stove.** All four use the os32-gcc16 stove (`STOVE=`).
- **The library's only outside code** is OpenGPU's batch builder, `vendor/openamigartg/library/opengpu/ogpu_build.c`. `vendor/openamigartg/OPENAMIGARTG_COMMIT` says which openamigartg commit it comes from.
- **The test needs** `m68k-linux-gnu-gcc` and `qemu-m68k`, and the Pixman release tarball in `tarballs/`. The test never fetches it: put it there, or run `fetch-sources.sh`.
- **`build-static.sh`** still builds upstream Pixman for AmigaOS as `libpixman-1.a`, for comparisons. pixman.library doesn't use it.

## Tests

- **`tests/run.sh`** runs `tests/pixmantest.c`. It is built for a big-endian 68040 and runs under qemu-m68k. It runs the library's core and OpenGPU's core beside upstream Pixman, on random cases:
  - composites: every operator and format above, solid and image sources and masks, repeat, translations and clipping;
  - fills, blits and rectangle fills;
  - region unions, intersections and copies.

  The results must be pixel-exact, apart from the bits a format leaves unused, and nothing may be refused. It also checks that a scaling transform, PAD repeat, a component-alpha mask and SATURATE are refused and leave the pixels alone.
- **PixmanTest** is the ABI smoke test on AmigaOS.
- **PixBench** is the correctness and timing harness on AmigaOS. It uses `timer.device` E-clock timing, and its binary is unchanged from 1.0.
- **Measurements.** `measurements/20261017-2.0-*` has 1.0 and 2.0 on AmigaChrome's AC090 (68040, OS 3.2.3), with OpenGPU's driver and without it.

## Browser

`BROWSER_ACCELERATION_DESIGN.md` explains why a fast 2D layer under the browser matters. cairo and WebKit link upstream Pixman statically today (openamigacairo). `DESIGN.md` section 1 lists what cairo calls, and so what pixman.library's interface still needs before cairo can use it.

## AC090's native helpers

`achelpers/` (SPD-20) belonged to 1.0. It routed Pixman's copies and fills through amigachrome-guest's AC090 magic functions. 2.0 has no copies or fills of its own: they are OpenGPU's FILL and COPY. `build-static.sh` still uses the helpers when it builds upstream Pixman.

## Licensing

OpenAmigaPixman's library, ABI and test code are MIT licensed by the AmigaChrome Team. The files in `vendor/openamigartg` keep openamigartg's MIT licence. Upstream Pixman, used by the tests and `build-static.sh` only, keeps its own MIT licence and copyright notices.
